<h2> About </h2>
[Resume (pdf)](/assets/pdf/Cyrus-Nolan-Resume.pdf)  

I’m interested in guidance, navigation, and control and I’d like to work on launch vehicles or reentry vehicles because they're exciting and because I want to be working on getting people to Mars as soon as possible. I used to want to play professional football. After finishing my undergraduate degree, I was training to get a professional football tryout but decided to stop because of injuries. I wasn’t having success with traditional physical therapy, so I became interested in learning where traditional physical therapy theory was going wrong for me and getting myself better. In a popular book called 'Can’t Hurt Me' by David Goggins, I read about a guy who successfully treated David’s injuries, which were similar to mine. I went to work for the guy, learned everything about his methodology, and fixed my knees, shoulder, and back. During this time, which was between 2020 and 2023, my professional sports aspirations were diminishing. Also during this time, there were exciting events in space like Crew Dragon, Inspiration 4, Starship, routine booster landings, and rapidly increasing launch cadence. These events, as well as some separation from football culture, made me realize there’s a lot of cooler, more impactful things I could do than play professional sports. I became excited about rockets and human space exploration and returned to school to take advanced classes like optimal control theory, estimation thoery, dynamics, and orbital mechanics, preparing myself for work as a guidance navigation and control engineer. 

Outside of my engineering aspirations, I like to read fantasy and sci-fi. My favorite series are Red Rising, The Kingkiller Chronicle, Ender's Game, and Ranger's Apprectice. I also like to train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. I'm a purple belt, and my main accomplishments are: 1st place 2023 IBJJF Dallas Open (blue belt division), 2nd place 2023 ADCC Dallas Open (intermediate divison), and 3rd place 2022 IBJFF World Championship (blue belt division).
