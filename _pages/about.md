<h2> About </h2>
[Resume (pdf)](/assets/pdf/Resume.pdf)  

I’m interested in guidance, navigation, and control, especially optimization-based modern conrol theory and estimation. I’d like to work on launch vehicles or spacecraft because they're exciting and because I want to be working on getting people to Mars as soon as possible. I used to want to play professional football. After finishing my undergraduate degree, I was training to get a professional football tryout but decided to stop because I had a lot of injures. I wasn’t having success with traditional physical therapy, so I became interested in learning why traditional physical therapy theory was going wrong for me and getting myself better. In a popular book called 'Can’t Hurt Me' by David Goggins, I read about a guy who successfully treated David’s injuries, which were similar to mine. I went to work for the guy, learned everything about his methodology, and fixed my knees, shoulder, and back.

During this time, which was between 2020 and 2023, my professional sports aspirations were diminishing. Also during this time, there were exciting events in space like Crew Dragon, Inspiration 4, Starship, routine booster landings, and rapidly increasing launch cadence. I became excited about rockets and human space exploration and returned to school to take advanced courses like optimal control theory, estimation thoery, dynamics, and orbital mechanics, preparing myself for work as a guidance navigation and control engineer. 

I like to read fantasy and sci-fi. I most recently (March 2024) finished 'The Martian' by Andy Weir. My all time favorite series are Red Rising, The Kingkiller Chronicle, and Ender's Game. I train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, in which I'm a purple belt. Also, I like to listen to The Kid Laroi.
